With the rise of ChatGPT and OpenAI models, coding and generating websites has became super convenient and efficient. A simple prompt to the GPT allows me to identify coding mistakes and debug errors. Having graduated with just a Sports Science Degree from NTU, I truly believe that if you are interested in something, do not feel afraid to try it. Sure, CS graduates might need stellar grades to even pick up coding skills, but dont let your degree or path restrict you from what you want to achieve. Initially, my goal was to create a functional website to blog and showcase who I am in the internet without paying any $$. Which I can say for now, I have achieved it.',

I truly resonate with the saying, "A healthy body leads to a healthy mind." Beyond health, I have a strong passion for big data and research, particularly in exercise science. Analyzing datasets to uncover compelling insights brings me tremendous joy. Coaching has also played a significant role in my journey, enhancing my confidence, people management skills, and ability to instill life values in children through sports.
